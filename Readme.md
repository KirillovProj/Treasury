# Welcome to the Code Treasury
### This is a big collection of code snippets that represent different aspects of Python programming language. Treasury will be updated regularly.

#### Most of the code snippets are crafted by me, but some of them were inspired by or taken from different books and other sources. Here is the list of literature used, definitely check it out for more context:
